     --contentPath          JSONPath of the content that is also verified matching the value of contentRegex before deleting a node. if the path does not exist the ndoe will not be deleted
     --contentRegex         a regex that will be applied to a given content path in case it exists. the node will only be deleted if the regex matches
     --purgeZombies         riak tends to create zombie entries sometimes. so documents that do not exist anymore but their key still shows up in the key listing. with this option set every single key will be loaded and if it cannot be found it will be purged.
